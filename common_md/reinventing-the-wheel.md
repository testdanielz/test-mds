> In programming, the phrase "reinventing the wheel" refers to the act of writing code to implement a function or feature that already exists in a library or framework. For example, if a programmer writes a function to sort a list of numbers when there is already a sorting function available in the standard library, they would be said to be "reinventing the wheel."

## Why reinvent the wheel?

### Why not use a library?

- **Learning:** I learn best by doing. I learn best by making mistakes. I learn best by reinventing the wheel.
- **Control:** I want to know exactly what's going on under the hood. I want to know exactly what's going on behind the scenes. I want to know exactly what's going on in the library.
- **Fun:** I enjoy the process of reinventing the wheel. I enjoy the process of making mistakes. I enjoy the process of learning.
