### FSE Software Requirements

**Product Owner sits together with developers and “explains” the requirements to them**

### User Stories = 3C's

- **Card + Conversation + Confirmation**
- **Card:** "reminder to talk about the requirement during the sprint"
  - Stories traditionally written on note cards
  - Cards may be annotated with estimates, notes, etc.
- **Conversation:** details behind the story come out with conversation with PO
- **Confirmation:** scenarios that will be used by the PO to validate implementation of the story (acceptance tests, written on the back of the card)

### Who writes the stories?

- PO
- Story writing workshop
  - Conducted at the beginning of the project
  - **Objective:** Create an initial list of stories
  - Representatives of the main users participate

#### Example: Online stores

- **Card:** "Confirm a purchase"
- **Conversation:** PO explains the methods of payment, installment and delivery options, etc.
- **Confirmation:**
  - Verify cash purchase and installment purchase
  - Verify with credit cards A, B and C
  - Verify with X and Y delivery options
  - ...

#### User Story writing format

- **Template** proposed by Connextra and extended by Mike Cohn:
  - **As a** < _type of user_ >, **I want** < _some goal_ > **so that** < _some reason_ >.

### User stories

**As a** user, **I want** to....

- **As a** user, **I want** to reserve a hotel room
- **As a** user, **I want** to cancel a reservation
- **As a** vacation traveller, **I want** to see photos of the hotels
- **As a** frequent flyer, **I want** to rebook a past trip **so that** I save time booking trips I take often

#### Details added in smaller sub-stories

#### A good user story should be INVEST

- ***I*ndependent** (of all others)
- ***N*egotiable** (not a specific contract for features)
- ***V*aluable** (or vertical)
- ***E*stimable** (to a good approximation)
- ***S*mall** (so as to fit within an iteration)
- ***T*estable** (in principle, even if there isn't a test for it yet)

### Stories ⇔ Functional Requirements

### Non-Functional Requirements

- Team must define NFR with PO
- Team must include NFR in the "Definition of Done" (DoD) of a sprint

### Personas

**Persona** = Name + Bio + Objectives
**_Associate user stories to a persona's goal/objective_**

##### Example

- **As Bob**, **I want** ... **so that** ....
- **As Alice**, **I want** ... **so that** ....
